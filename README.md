xterm_icons
===========

A quick script to pull up a different colored icon for your xterm.  See https://gist.github.com/4582553 for a bit to add the current path to your title.

Edit the script to point to the various terminal icons.

Make the script executable, and set up an alias in your .bashrc (or equivalent) like this:

alias xterm='xterm -e "xicons.sh;bash"'
